The purpose of the first part is to check the power of the normality tests for a mixture of two normal distributions. Means and standard deviations of both distributions were taken into account, as well as sample sizes and the probability of using one of the distributions.  
The aim of the second part is to check the power of the Wilcoxon test for a mixture of two Poisson distributions. As in the first part, the sample size, the probability of using one of the distributions and the parameters of both distributions (lambda) were also taken into account.
